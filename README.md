<h1>Todo app in Go</h1>
<img src="screenshot.png">
Todo app can store, delete, create your todo's with (not very) fine user interface.
Tested and created on [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) , OS: macOS Big Sur.
UI library is [webview](https://github.com/webview/webview_go) , frontend code was successfully copied and a little bit modified from (here)[https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp].
Clone this project and control your todo's with (not very) this fine "ToDo app".
